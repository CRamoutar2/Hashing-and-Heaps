# Hashing-and-Heaps
CSCI 335: Project 3- Hashing Project

In this project, students had to take in a text file, probe/hash the text, and output the values necessary. 

In addition, students had to implement double hashing and a function to find positions to provide probes throughout the text. 

Lastly, students had to use what they learned to implement a spell-check feature in the program. 

The full instructions are in the file labeled "Homework3_Hashing.pdf"

I received a 105/130 for this project - 80%.
